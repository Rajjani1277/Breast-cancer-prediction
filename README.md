# Breast-cancer-prediction
Predict if patient have breast cancer or not using logistic regression algorithm.
First we take Data from file Data.csv using pandas library. Then we done data cleaning and processing by removing null data and convert categorical data into integer data.
Then we split out data training set and testing set and do scaling of data by standardscalar.Now here logistic regression is best algorithm for our data. So we fit our model in Logistic regression algorithm and predict test data.
And we have got prediction accuracy of 96.5%.AS per confusion metrix we have predicted 5/165 data wrong
